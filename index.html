<p>User problem: Sometimes college students experience a hard time managing their personal budgets. A website will allow students to set financial goals for themselves and track their expenses. It will provide answers: "How much do I need to spend or save today to meet my long-term or short-term financial goal?", "What are the benefits of saving?", "Where should I invest to earn the best return?"</p>
<p>Users: The application would meet the need of college students who have limited amount of money for their needs and want an effective way to make sure they do not overspend. The application can be also useful for any person seeking creative and efficient ways to use the saved money.</p>
<p>Comparison: There are existing applications that track people's budgets and provide financial ideas. However, my project will also provide comprehensive stock evaluations and their performance predictions, keeping people informed of all the updates. In this way, people will not only be able to learn personal finance but also gain valuable investment management skills which will help them in any area of life </p>
